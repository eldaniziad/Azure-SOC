## Introduction

In this project, I design and deployed a honeynet within the Azure platform, with the objective of demonstrating best security practices and incident response strategies while assessing the impact of environment hardening on security metrics. The project involved the collection of log sources from diverse origins, which were consolidated into a **Log Analytics workspace**. This workspace formed the foundation for **Microsoft Sentinel's** operations, facilitating the construction of attack maps, the triggering of alerts, and the generation of incidents.

The honeynet was initially set up in a vulnerable state, open to internet traffic, to attract potential attackers and simulate real-world threats. This setup enabled the capture and analysis of security metrics over a 24-hour period, providing a baseline for the insecure environment. Following this, I implemented targeted security controls aimed at protecting the environment, after which I conducted a second round of metric measurement over another 24-hour period to evaluate the effectiveness of these controls.

Additionally, the project incorporated **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to assess virtual machine configurations and align them with regulatory frameworks and security controls. A critical part of this phase involved addressing incidents identified by Microsoft Sentinel and applying recommendations from Microsoft Defender to enhance security.

The metrics collected and analyzed in this project include:

1. **SecurityEvent**: Windows Event Logs, providing insights into security-related events within the Windows operating system.
2. **Syslog**: Linux Event Logs, offering a view into security events occurring within Linux systems.
3. **SecurityAlert**: Alerts triggered in Log Analytics, highlighting potential security issues detected in the environment.
4. **SecurityIncident**: Incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel, reflecting significant security events requiring investigation and response.
5. **AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL**: Identified malicious network flows permitted into our honeynet, tracking unauthorized or suspicious network traffic.

This project offers valuable insights into the scope of cyber threats and defense mechanisms but also serves as a case study for the effective use of Azure and Microsoft Sentinel in creating and managing a secure and resilient digital environment.
