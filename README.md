## Introduction

In this project, I design and deployed a honeynet within the Azure platform, with the objective of demonstrating best security practices and incident response strategies while assessing the impact of environment hardening on security metrics. The project involved the collection of log sources from diverse origins, which were consolidated into a **Log Analytics workspace**. This workspace formed the foundation for **Microsoft Sentinel's** operations, facilitating the construction of attack maps, the triggering of alerts, and the generation of incidents.

The honeynet was initially set up in a vulnerable state, open to internet traffic, to attract potential attackers and simulate real-world threats. This setup enabled the capture and analysis of security metrics over a 24-hour period, providing a baseline for the insecure environment. Following this, I implemented targeted security controls aimed at protecting the environment, after which I conducted a second round of metric measurement over another 24-hour period to evaluate the effectiveness of these controls.

Additionally, the project incorporated **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** to assess virtual machine configurations and align them with regulatory frameworks and security controls. A critical part of this phase involved addressing incidents identified by Microsoft Sentinel and applying recommendations from Microsoft Defender to enhance security.

The metrics collected and analyzed in this project include:

1. **SecurityEvent**: Windows Event Logs, providing insights into security-related events within the Windows operating system.
2. **Syslog**: Linux Event Logs, offering a view into security events occurring within Linux systems.
3. **SecurityAlert**: Alerts triggered in Log Analytics, highlighting potential security issues detected in the environment.
4. **SecurityIncident**: Incidents generated by Microsoft Sentinel, reflecting significant security events requiring investigation and response.
5. **AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL**: Identified malicious network flows permitted into our honeynet, tracking unauthorized or suspicious network traffic.

This project offers valuable insights into the scope of cyber threats and defense mechanisms but also serves as a case study for the effective use of Azure and Microsoft Sentinel in creating and managing a secure and resilient digital environment.

### Objective

The central goal of this project was to establish a network of intentionally vulnerable virtual machines within the Azure infrastructure. This approach served two primary objectives. Firstly, it functioned as a honeypot strategy to attract and analyze cyber attacks. By deliberately introducing vulnerabilities, these virtual machines became enticing targets for attackers, creating an opportunity to study their tactics and techniques in a controlled environment. This aspect of the project was crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of the nature and methodology of cyber threats.

Secondly, the project served as a platform to demonstrate my skills and proficiency in responding to security incidents. The setup allowed me to monitor, detect, and react to cyber attacks in real-time. This hands-on experience was helpful for developing my ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities and breaches effectively and efficiently.

# Process and Methodology

In this cybersecurity project, the process and methodology encompassed distinct phases, each designed to systematically analyze and improve the security posture of a virtual environment in Microsoft Azure. Here's an overview of each phase:

### **Phase I - Creating The Honeynet**

- The project started with the deployment of multiple vulnerable virtual machines in Azure, simulating an insecure environment that attracts cyber attackers.

### **Phase II - Simulated Attacks & Logging and Monitoring**

- Simulated attacks were created to manually trigger events, including brute force attempts and malware injections. This phase also involved using KQL queries to analyze triggered events and alerts from both simulated and actual attacks.

### **Phase III - Analysis & Incident Assessment and Response**

- A thorough assessment of incidents generated during the 24-hour insecure environment operation was conducted. This included analyzing the entities responsible for attacks, their tactics, techniques, types of attacks, and timelines.

### **Phase IV - Remediation & Regulatory Compliance Implementation**

- Post-analysis, security controls were implemented to secure the environment. This involved disabling public access, creating private endpoints, establishing additional network security groups, and configuring NSG rules. These measures were aligned with NIST 800-53 regulatory compliance standards, emphasizing access control and system integrity.

### **Phase V - Results & Metrics Comparison**

- The final phase involved measuring and recording results and metrics from both insecure and secure environments to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented security controls.

# **Architecture BEFORE Hardening and Implementing Security Controls**

In the "BEFORE" stage of the project, I purposefully deployed resources without any security hardening to create a deliberately insecure environment, aimed at attracting potential cyber attackers for the purpose of analyzing their methods. During this phase:

1. **Public Exposure**: All resources, including Virtual Machines (VMs), storage accounts, and databases, were deployed with direct public exposure to the internet, making them accessible from any external source without restrictions.
2. **Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Firewalls**: The VMs were configured with their Network Security Groups (NSGs) and built-in firewalls set to allow all incoming and outgoing traffic, thereby providing an open gateway for potential attackers.
3. **Public Endpoints**: I deployed other resources with publicly visible endpoints, intentionally refraining from using Private Endpoints which offer a more secure and isolated connection.

This approach was designed to actively engage with and study cyber attack patterns, techniques, and their effects on the intentionally vulnerable environment, providing valuable insights into the types of vulnerabilities and risks present in such an exposed setup.

# **Architecture AFTER Hardening and Implementing Security Controls**

In the "AFTER" stage of the project, I implemented a series of security controls and hardening measures to align with the **NIST SP 800-53 Rev4 SC-7(3) Access Points** standards. These enhancements significantly increased the security posture of our environment:

1. **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: I modified NSGs to block all inbound and outbound traffic, except for specific public IP addresses that required access to the virtual machines. This approach ensured that only authorized and trusted traffic could interact with the VMs.
2. **Built-in Firewalls**: The built-in firewalls in Azure were configured on each virtual machine. This involved creating firewall rules based on each VM's specific services and responsibilities, further reducing the attack surface accessible to malicious actors.
3. **Private Endpoints**: I transitioned from Public Endpoints to Private Endpoints for Azure Key Vault and Storage Containers. This change ensured that access to these critical resources was restricted to the virtual network, isolating them from the public internet.
4. **Subnetting**: An additional layer of security was introduced by creating a dedicated subnet for Azure Key Vault and Storage Containers. This subnetting strategy further segmented network traffic to provide an extra barrier of protection and limiting potential attack vectors.

Through these bolstered security enhancements, I significantly strengthened the defense of  the virtual environment against cyber threats, demonstrating the effectiveness of a multi-layered security approach.

# Utilizing NIST SP 800.61 Computer Incident Handling Guide

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8566cf8-2e19-4897-9f1b-c483e6be2c48" alt="nistsp800.61" width="500" height="auto">
</div>
During each simulated attack in the project, I followed the NIST SP 800-61 guidelines for incident response. This structured approach ensured a comprehensive and effective response to each simulated cybersecurity event. The process was divided into distinct stages, each focusing on a crucial aspect of incident management:

### **Preparation**

- The Azure lab was set up to aggregate all logs into the Log Analytics Workspace. Both Microsoft Sentinel and Defender were configured with alert rules in place, setting the stage for efficient monitoring and alerting.

### **Detection & Analysis**

- Upon detecting malware on a workstation, the response involved several steps:
    - Assigning an alert owner, setting the severity to "High," and marking the status as "Active."
    - Identifying the primary user account and all affected systems.
    - Conducting a full system scan using updated antivirus software to pinpoint the malware.
    - Confirming the alert as a "True Positive."
    - Notifying the appropriate personnel in accordance with the organization's communication policies.

### **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**

- The response to the malware infection included:
    - Quarantining the infected system and any other systems impacted by the malware.
    - Shutting down and disconnecting the system from the network if malware removal or system damage was extensive.
    - Restoring affected systems to a known clean state using system images, clean OS installations, or cleaning with an up-to-date antivirus solution, depending on organizational policies.

### **Post-Incident Activity**

- Following the simulated incident:
    - An analysis was conducted to identify the root cause, which was traced to an employee downloading a game containing malware.
    - A comprehensive report was created and disseminated to all stakeholders.
    - Corrective actions were taken to address the root cause.
    - A lessons-learned review was conducted to evaluate the incident response and improve future practices.

# **Conclusion & Reflection**

This home-lab project involved the construction of an effective honeynet in Microsoft Azure, showcasing the critical importance of strong security measures in cloud environments. By integrating log sources into a Log Analytics workspace and employing Microsoft Sentinel to generate alerts and incidents, I gained valuable insights into the security posture of our virtual environment.

Key points from the project include:

1. **Security Measurement**: Metrics were collected both before and after implementing security controls, providing a clear comparison of the security environment's effectiveness.
2. **Effective Security Controls**: The implementation of security measures led to a drastic reduction in the number of security events and incidents, demonstrating their efficacy.
3. **Potential Impact of Regular Use**: It's important to note that if the network resources were heavily utilized by regular users, the number of security events and alerts might have increased post-implementation due to heightened activity.
4. **Adherence to Standards**: By aligning with standards such as NIST SP 800-53 r4, I significantly enhanced the security of our honeynet.
5. **Reflection and Importance of Security**: The project highlighted the essential nature of security controls and configurations in protecting resources. The comparison of metrics before and after security implementation underscored the difference between an insecure and a secure environment.

In conclusion, the project not only emphasized the importance of having proper security controls in place but also provided a practical demonstration of the transformative impact these controls can have on the security of cloud-based resources. The use of tools like Microsoft Sentinel, coupled with strategic security implementations, proved to be vital in safeguarding the environment against threats and unauthorized access.
